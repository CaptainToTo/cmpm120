## Requirements

- **Continuous and Discrete Iput**: The hand the player controls follows the mouse continuously, while clicking causes a discrete action.
- **Player's Goal Can Only Be Achieved Indirectly**: Player is reliant on the gravity physics applied to the balls in order to reach the juggle count goal.
- **3+ Physics Based Gameplay Scenes**: 6 levels use physics for the main juggling gameplay.
- **Separate Levels Contextualize the Gameplay Scenes**: The level select and menu scene use the main interaction of clicking on bouncing balls to prepare the player for the main gameplay loop.
